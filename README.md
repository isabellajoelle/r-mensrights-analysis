# r/mensrights Analysis: Final Project for HSS 131

Hi!

The website was built and submitted as the final project for my Introduction to Anthropology course at Stevens Institute of Technology. In this course, I did a semester-long study of the subreddit r/mensrights. Disclaimer: I am a beginner anthropologist, so my findings are not to be taken seriously; however, I had a lot of fun analyzing the behavior of this community and building this website to display my research.
